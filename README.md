# Genetic-Algorithm-Genetic-Programming

#|
In this project we will produce three things:

1. A high-level evolutionary computation framework

2. The representation, breeding functions, and evaluations to do a simple
GA for boolean vectors and for floating-point vectors, including a few test
functions on each.

3. The representation, breeding functions, and evaluations to do GP for
two problems:
A. Symbolic Regression
B. Artificial Ant

The high-level EC system will work as follows:

- Simple generational evolution
- GA-style Tournament selection
- A simple breeding function
- some simple statistics functions
